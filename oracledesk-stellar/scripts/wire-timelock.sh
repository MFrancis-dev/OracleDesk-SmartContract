# Move an existing testnet deployment's admin role to the governance timelock
# (#63, docs/adr/0008-governance-timelock.md) using the two-step admin transfer
# from #62 (docs/adr/0007-two-step-admin-transfer.md).
#
# For each of market-core, resolver, treasury and reasoning-registry:
#   1. the current admin proposes the timelock as the new admin;
#   2. the timelock's `accept_admin` call is scheduled through the timelock and
#      must be executed after the delay (the timelock cannot be a CLI source
#      account, and its auth must be anchored contract-to-contract).
# The script is idempotent: a contract already governed by the timelock is
# skipped. The pending proposal expires after seven days, so execute the
# scheduled accept within that window (the timelock delay is smaller).
#
# After this, every admin action on those contracts must go through
# timelock.schedule / timelock.execute.
